## **Exchange economy and Marginal products**

### **Part (a)**

#### Problem Definition

There is one **non‑money** commodity (call it “the good”) and **money** as the numéraire (its price is normalized to 1). Buyers and sellers have **quasi‑linear** preferences, so each person chooses the quantity of the good to maximize “utility from the good minus the money spent/received.” In quasi‑linear settings, the optimal interior choice equates **marginal utility** to the **market price** of the good; this is the key first‑order condition we will use. Market clearing for the non‑money good requires that the total quantity bought by all buyers equals the total quantity sold by all sellers. These are precisely the competitive‑equilibrium ingredients in our lecture notes on general equilibrium with a numéraire and quasi‑linearity.

_What is given:_ All buyers are identical with\
$$v_b(z_b)=\beta z_b-\tfrac12\gamma z_b^2$$​ for $$z_b\ge 0$$ (and $$-\infty$$ otherwise),\
all sellers are identical with\
$$v_s(z_s)=-\tfrac12\sigma z_s^2$$ for $$z_s\le 0$$ (and $$-\infty$$ otherwise),\
and there are $$M$$ buyers and $$N$$ sellers. We are asked to find the Walrasian price $$p$$ and each agent’s optimal choice $$z_b^{*}$$​ and $$z_s^{*}$$​.

#### Step 1. Individual optimization at price p

**Buyer’s problem** (choose a nonnegative purchase $$z_b$$​):

$$
\max_{z_b\ge 0}\ \ \beta z_b-\tfrac12\gamma z_b^2 - p\,z_b.
$$

**Buyer’s first‑order condition** for an interior optimum ($$z_b>0$$):

$$
\beta-\gamma z_b - p = 0 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad z_b(p)=\frac{\beta-p}{\gamma}.
$$

**Buyer’s nonnegativity constraint** implies the individual demand function:

$$
z_b(p)=\max\Big\{0,\ \frac{\beta-p}{\gamma}\Big\}.
$$

This uses the lecture‑note rule “set $$v'(x)=p$$” under quasi‑linearity (here $$v_b'(z_b)=\beta-\gamma z_b$$​).

**Seller’s problem** (choose a nonpositive supply $$z_s$$​; a negative $$z_s$$​ means selling $$|z_s|$$):

$$
\max_{z_s\le 0}\ \ -\tfrac12\sigma z_s^2 - p\,z_s.
$$

**Seller’s first‑order condition** (the solution automatically satisfies $$z_s\le 0$$ when $$p\ge 0$$):

$$
-\sigma z_s - p = 0 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad z_s(p) = -\frac{p}{\sigma}.
$$

Intuition: the seller increases $$|z_s|$$ until the (positive) marginal money gain $$p$$ equals the marginal disutility $$\sigma |z_s|$$ from parting with more of the good. The FOCs and this interpretation match the numéraire‑plus‑one‑good treatment in our notes.

#### Step 2. Market clearing for the non‑money good

Because the total amount bought must equal the total amount sold, the aggregate feasibility condition is

$$
M\,z_b(p) + N\,z_s(p) = 0.
$$

This is the standard “sum of individual net demands equals zero” condition for the non‑money good in competitive equilibrium.

With the interior buyer demand (which will be valid at the equilibrium we find), substitute $$z_b(p)=(\beta-p)/\gamma$$ and $$z_s(p)=-p/\sigma$$ to get

$$
M\Big(\frac{\beta-p}{\gamma}\Big) + N\Big(-\frac{p}{\sigma}\Big) = 0.
$$

Collecting terms in $$p$$ gives

$$
\frac{M\beta}{\gamma} \;=\; p\Big(\frac{M}{\gamma}+\frac{N}{\sigma}\Big).
$$

#### Step 3. Solve for the Walrasian price p

$$
p^{*} \;=\; \frac{\displaystyle \frac{M\beta}{\gamma}}{\displaystyle \frac{M}{\gamma}+\frac{N}{\sigma}} \;=\; \frac{M\beta\sigma}{M\sigma+N\gamma}.
$$

This price satisfies $$0<p^{*}<\beta$$ when $$M,N,\beta,\gamma,\sigma>0$$, so the buyer solution is indeed interior and the seller solution is nonpositive, as required. (The “interiority $$v'(z)=p$$” and market‑clearing logic are exactly how the notes characterize competitive equilibrium with a numéraire.)

#### Step 4. Plug back to get individual choices​

$$
z_b^{*} = \frac{\beta - p^{*}}{\gamma} = \frac{\beta - \frac{M\beta\sigma}{M\sigma+N\gamma}}{\gamma} = \frac{\beta N}{M\sigma+N\gamma}.
$$

$$
z_s^{*} = -\frac{p^{*}}{\sigma} = -\frac{1}{\sigma}\cdot\frac{M\beta\sigma}{M\sigma+N\gamma} = -\frac{M\beta}{M\sigma+N\gamma}.
$$

A quick check shows market clearing holds agent‑by‑agent totals.

$$
M\,z_b^{*} + N\,z_s^{*} = M\Big(\frac{\beta N}{M\sigma+N\gamma}\Big) + N\Big(-\frac{M\beta}{M\sigma+N\gamma}\Big) = 0.
$$

#### Final answer (requested objects)

$$
\boxed{\,p^{*}=\dfrac{M\beta\sigma}{M\sigma+N\gamma}\,}
$$

$$
\boxed{\,z_b^{*}=\dfrac{\beta N}{M\sigma+N\gamma}\quad\text{for each buyer,}\qquad z_s^{*}=-\dfrac{M\beta}{M\sigma+N\gamma}\quad\text{for each seller.}\,}
$$

A buyer purchases until **marginal benefit** $$(\beta-\gamma z_b)$$ equals **price** $$p$$; a seller sells until the **marginal disutility** $$\sigma|z_s|$$ equals the same price. The equilibrium price balances the total quantity $$M$$ buyers want with the total quantity $$N$$ sellers are willing to release. More buyers $$M$$ or a higher taste parameter $$\beta$$ pushes price up; more elastic buyer side (larger $$\gamma$$) or more elastic seller side (smaller $$\sigma$$) pulls it down. All of this follows the quasi‑linear competitive‑equilibrium template from the notes (money as numéraire, $$v'(x)=p$$, and market clearing).
