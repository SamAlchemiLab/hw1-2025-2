## **Exchange economy and Marginal products**

### **Part (a)**

#### Problem Definition

There is one **non‑money** commodity (call it “the good”) and **money** as the numéraire (its price is normalized to 1). Buyers and sellers have **quasi‑linear** preferences, so each person chooses the quantity of the good to maximize “utility from the good minus the money spent/received.” In quasi‑linear settings, the optimal interior choice equates **marginal utility** to the **market price** of the good; this is the key first‑order condition we will use. Market clearing for the non‑money good requires that the total quantity bought by all buyers equals the total quantity sold by all sellers. These are precisely the competitive‑equilibrium ingredients in our lecture notes on general equilibrium with a numéraire and quasi‑linearity.

_What is given:_ All buyers are identical with\
$$v_b(z_b)=\beta z_b-\tfrac12\gamma z_b^2$$​ for $$z_b\ge 0$$ (and $$-\infty$$ otherwise),\
all sellers are identical with\
$$v_s(z_s)=-\tfrac12\sigma z_s^2$$ for $$z_s\le 0$$ (and $$-\infty$$ otherwise),\
and there are $$M$$ buyers and $$N$$ sellers. We are asked to find the Walrasian price $$p$$ and each agent’s optimal choice $$z_b^{*}$$​ and $$z_s^{*}$$​.

#### Step 1. Individual optimization at price p

**Buyer’s problem** (choose a nonnegative purchase $$z_b$$​):

$$
\max_{z_b\ge 0}\ \ \beta z_b-\tfrac12\gamma z_b^2 - p\,z_b.
$$

**Buyer’s first‑order condition** for an interior optimum ($$z_b>0$$):

$$
\beta-\gamma z_b - p = 0 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad z_b(p)=\frac{\beta-p}{\gamma}.
$$

**Buyer’s nonnegativity constraint** implies the individual demand function:

$$
z_b(p)=\max\Big\{0,\ \frac{\beta-p}{\gamma}\Big\}.
$$

This uses the lecture‑note rule “set $$v'(x)=p$$” under quasi‑linearity (here $$v_b'(z_b)=\beta-\gamma z_b$$​).

**Seller’s problem** (choose a nonpositive supply $$z_s$$​; a negative $$z_s$$​ means selling $$|z_s|$$):

$$
\max_{z_s\le 0}\ \ -\tfrac12\sigma z_s^2 - p\,z_s.
$$

**Seller’s first‑order condition** (the solution automatically satisfies $$z_s\le 0$$ when $$p\ge 0$$):

$$
-\sigma z_s - p = 0 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad z_s(p) = -\frac{p}{\sigma}.
$$

Intuition: the seller increases $$|z_s|$$ until the (positive) marginal money gain $$p$$ equals the marginal disutility $$\sigma |z_s|$$ from parting with more of the good. The FOCs and this interpretation match the numéraire‑plus‑one‑good treatment in our notes.

#### Step 2. Market clearing for the non‑money good

Because the total amount bought must equal the total amount sold, the aggregate feasibility condition is

$$
M\,z_b(p) + N\,z_s(p) = 0.
$$

This is the standard “sum of individual net demands equals zero” condition for the non‑money good in competitive equilibrium.

With the interior buyer demand (which will be valid at the equilibrium we find), substitute $$z_b(p)=(\beta-p)/\gamma$$ and $$z_s(p)=-p/\sigma$$ to get

$$
M\Big(\frac{\beta-p}{\gamma}\Big) + N\Big(-\frac{p}{\sigma}\Big) = 0.
$$

Collecting terms in $$p$$ gives

$$
\frac{M\beta}{\gamma} \;=\; p\Big(\frac{M}{\gamma}+\frac{N}{\sigma}\Big).
$$

#### Step 3. Solve for the Walrasian price p

$$
p^{*} \;=\; \frac{\displaystyle \frac{M\beta}{\gamma}}{\displaystyle \frac{M}{\gamma}+\frac{N}{\sigma}} \;=\; \frac{M\beta\sigma}{M\sigma+N\gamma}.
$$

This price satisfies $$0<p^{*}<\beta$$ when $$M,N,\beta,\gamma,\sigma>0$$, so the buyer solution is indeed interior and the seller solution is nonpositive, as required. (The “interiority $$v'(z)=p$$” and market‑clearing logic are exactly how the notes characterize competitive equilibrium with a numéraire.)

#### Step 4. Plug back to get individual choices​

$$
z_b^{*} = \frac{\beta - p^{*}}{\gamma} = \frac{\beta - \frac{M\beta\sigma}{M\sigma+N\gamma}}{\gamma} = \frac{\beta N}{M\sigma+N\gamma}.
$$

$$
z_s^{*} = -\frac{p^{*}}{\sigma} = -\frac{1}{\sigma}\cdot\frac{M\beta\sigma}{M\sigma+N\gamma} = -\frac{M\beta}{M\sigma+N\gamma}.
$$

A quick check shows market clearing holds agent‑by‑agent totals.

$$
M\,z_b^{*} + N\,z_s^{*} = M\Big(\frac{\beta N}{M\sigma+N\gamma}\Big) + N\Big(-\frac{M\beta}{M\sigma+N\gamma}\Big) = 0.
$$

#### Final answer

$$
\boxed{\,p^{*}=\dfrac{M\beta\sigma}{M\sigma+N\gamma}\,}
$$

$$
\boxed{\,z_b^{*}=\dfrac{\beta N}{M\sigma+N\gamma}\quad\text{for each buyer,}\qquad z_s^{*}=-\dfrac{M\beta}{M\sigma+N\gamma}\quad\text{for each seller.}\,}
$$

A buyer purchases until **marginal benefit** $$(\beta-\gamma z_b)$$ equals **price** $$p$$; a seller sells until the **marginal disutility** $$\sigma|z_s|$$ equals the same price. The equilibrium price balances the total quantity $$M$$ buyers want with the total quantity $$N$$ sellers are willing to release. More buyers $$M$$ or a higher taste parameter $$\beta$$ pushes price up; more elastic buyer side (larger $$\gamma$$) or more elastic seller side (smaller $$\sigma$$) pulls it down. All of this follows the quasi‑linear competitive‑equilibrium template from the notes (money as numéraire, $$v'(x)=p$$, and market clearing).

### **Part (b)**

#### Problem Definition

We want the planner’s “total surplus” from trading the one non‑money good between identical buyers and identical sellers. Each buyer consumes a non‑negative amount $$z_b$$​ and each seller consumes a non‑positive amount $$z_s$$​. With $$M$$ buyers and $$N$$ sellers, feasibility of the non‑money good requires $$M z_b + N z_s = 0$$. The planner’s objective (sum of quasi‑linear utilities) is to maximize $$M v_b(z_b) + N v_s(z_s)$$ subject to that feasibility.

Because preferences are quasi‑linear (utility in money is linear) and strictly concave in the non‑money good, efficiency can be computed by “ignoring money” and maximizing the sum of the non‑money parts under the resource constraint; moreover, the efficient allocation is unique. Intuitively, we will pick one common $$z_b$$​ for all buyers and one common $$z_s$$​ for all sellers by symmetry and concavity.

#### **Step 1. Write the objective and the constraint.**

$$
\max_{z_b \ge 0,\; z_s \le 0}\; M\!\left[\beta z_b - \tfrac{\gamma}{2} z_b^2\right] + N\!\left[-\,\tfrac{\sigma}{2} z_s^2\right]
$$

$$
\text{s.t.}\;\; M z_b + N z_s = 0
$$

Here we used the given quadratic forms $$(z_b)=\beta z_b-\frac{\gamma}{2}z_b^2$$ for buyers and $$v_s(z_s)=-\frac{\sigma}{2}$$​ for sellers.

#### **Step 2. Solve with a Lagrangian.**

$$
\mathcal{L} \;=\; M\!\left[\beta z_b - \tfrac{\gamma}{2} z_b^2\right] + N\!\left[-\,\tfrac{\sigma}{2} z_s^2\right] + \lambda\,(M z_b + N z_s)
$$

First‑order conditions for an interior optimum are:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z_b}:\;\; M(\beta - \gamma z_b) + \lambda M = 0 \;\;\Longrightarrow\;\; \beta - \gamma z_b + \lambda = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z_s}:\;\; N(-\sigma z_s) + \lambda N = 0 \;\;\Longrightarrow\;\; -\sigma z_s + \lambda = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda}:\;\; M z_b + N z_s = 0
$$

From the first two conditions we get the optimality link:

$$
\gamma z_b - \beta \;=\; \sigma z_s
$$

This says “buyers’ marginal benefit from one more unit” equals “sellers’ marginal harm (in utility units) from giving up one more unit.” With strictly concave $$v$$’s, this first‑order system yields the unique solution.

#### **Step 3. Use feasibility to solve for zb\* and zs\*​.**

$$
z_s \;=\; -\frac{M}{N}\,z_b \quad\Longrightarrow\quad \gamma z_b - \beta \;=\; \sigma\!\left(-\frac{M}{N}z_b\right)
$$

$$
\Big(\gamma + \frac{\sigma M}{N}\Big)z_b \;=\; \beta
$$

$$
\boxed{\,z_b^* \;=\; \frac{\beta}{\,\gamma + \frac{\sigma M}{N}\,}\;=\;\frac{\beta N}{\gamma N + \sigma M}\,}
$$

$$
\boxed{\,z_s^* \;=\; -\,\frac{M}{N}\,z_b^* \;=\; -\,\frac{\beta M}{\gamma N + \sigma M}\,}
$$

These satisfy $$z_b^*\ge 0$$ and $$z_s^*\le 0$$ (since $$\beta>0$$), so the solution is interior and consistent with the domains stated in the problem.

#### **Step 4. Compute the maximum gains from trade.**

Plugging $$z_s = -(M/N)z_b$$​ into the objective collapses it to a single‑variable quadratic in $$z_b$$​:

$$
M\beta z_b \;-\; \frac{1}{2}\Big[\gamma M + \frac{\sigma M^2}{N}\Big] z_b^2
$$

The concave quadratic $$A z - \tfrac{1}{2}B z^2$$ attains its maximum at $$z=A/B$$ with value $$\tfrac{1}{2}\,A^2/B$$. Here $$A=M\beta$$ and $$B=\gamma M + \frac{\sigma M^2}{N}$$​. Therefore,

$$
v_I(0)\;=\;\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{(M\beta)^2}{\,\gamma M + \frac{\sigma M^2}{N}\,}
$$

$$
\boxed{\,v_I(0)\;=\;\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{M N\,\beta^2}{\gamma N + \sigma M}\,}
$$

This is the **maximum total gains from trade** when buyers and sellers of each type are treated symmetrically, as the note under part (b) presumes.

#### **Intuition**

Quasi‑linearity lets us “separate” money from the real decision and pick the non‑money quantities to maximize the sum of $$v$$’s under the resource constraint. The first‑order condition equalizes the buyers’ marginal benefit to the (absolute) marginal utility cost on the sellers’ side. More buyers $$M$$ push down the per‑buyer quantity $$z_b^*$$​ because each unit must be taken from the fixed pool of sellers; more sellers $$N$$ raise $$z_b^*$$​ because the “sacrifice per seller” is spread thinner. Strict concavity makes the allocation unique.

### Part (c)

#### Problem Definition

Show that the allocation of the non‑money good you found in (a) (the Walrasian competitive equilibrium) coincides with the allocation that maximizes total surplus in (b). Then describe how the set of all Pareto‑optimal allocations relates to the allocation in (a).

#### Step 1 — Write down the competitive‑equilibrium conditions

With a money numéraire (price 1) and one non‑money good, quasi‑linearity lets us solve each agent’s choice by equating “marginal utility” to the market price of the non‑money good. For a representative buyer and seller in this homework:

Buyer’s first‑order condition:

$$
v_b'(z_b)=p
$$

Seller’s first‑order condition (note the seller chooses a non‑positive $$z_s$$​):

$$
v_s'(z_s)=p
$$

Market‑clearing across $$M$$ identical buyers and $$N$$ identical sellers:

$$
M\,z_b+N\,z_s=0
$$

The notes justify these FOCs for quasi‑linear utilities and stress that the money good can be “ignored” when solving the non‑money allocation.

Plug in the specific $$v_b$$​ and $$v_s$$​:

$$
v_b'(z_b)=\beta-\gamma z_b,\qquad v_s'(z_s)=-\sigma z_s.
$$

Thus the competitive‑equilibrium system is:

$$
\beta-\gamma z_b=p,\qquad -\sigma z_s=p,\qquad M z_b+N z_s=0.
$$

Solving gives the Walrasian allocation and price (from part (a)):

$$
z_b^{CE}=\frac{\beta\,N}{\;M\sigma+\gamma N\;}, \qquad z_s^{CE}=-\frac{M\beta}{\;M\sigma+\gamma N\;}, \qquad p^{CE}=\frac{M\beta\,\sigma}{\;M\sigma+\gamma N\;}.
$$

#### Step 2 — Solve the planner’s problem in (b) and compare

Part (b) maximizes total surplus subject to feasibility and symmetry:

$$
\max_{z_b,z_s}\;\; M\,v_b(z_b)+N\,v_s(z_s)\quad\text{s.t.}\quad M z_b+N z_s=0.
$$

Use the constraint $$z_s=-(M/N)\,z_b$$​ and differentiate the objective with respect to $$z_b$$​. The first‑order condition becomes:

$$
M\,v_b'(z_b)-M\,v_s'(z_s)=0\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad v_b'(z_b)=v_s'(z_s).
$$

Now substitute the derivatives of $$v_b$$​ and $$v_s$$​ and the feasibility relation $$z_s=-(M/N)z_b$$​:

$$
\beta-\gamma z_b = -\sigma z_s = \sigma\Big(\tfrac{M}{N}\Big) z_b.
$$

Hence,

$$
\beta=z_b\Big(\gamma+\sigma\frac{M}{N}\Big)\quad\Longrightarrow\quad z_b^{SP}=\frac{\beta\,N}{\;M\sigma+\gamma N\;},\qquad z_s^{SP}=-\frac{M\beta}{\;M\sigma+\gamma N\;}.
$$

So the surplus‑maximizing allocation $$(z_b^{SP},z_s^{SP})$$ is exactly the same as the competitive‑equilibrium allocation $$(z_b^{CE},z_s^{CE})$$ from Step 1. This is the textbook “equalize marginal benefits across sides subject to feasibility” condition that the notes identify with efficiency; with quasi‑linearity, it coincides with competitive equilibrium.

#### Step 3 — Why the coincidence must hold

In a private‑goods exchange economy with well‑behaved preferences, the First Welfare Theorem (FWT) says any competitive equilibrium allocation is Pareto‑efficient, and the Second Welfare Theorem (SWT) says any Pareto‑efficient allocation can be decentralized as a competitive equilibrium (after suitable lump‑sum money transfers). This is exactly the logic shown in the calculation above: the CE FOCs and the planner’s FOCs deliver the same physical allocation of the non‑money good.

The notes further emphasize that with quasi‑linearity the condition “$$\nabla v_i =$$ prices” pins down a unique efficient physical allocation of the non‑money good (under strict concavity), independently of who holds how much money. Money can be redistributed without changing the non‑money optimum.

#### Step 4 — Characterize the whole set of Pareto‑optimal allocations

Because utilities are quasi‑linear in money:

The physical allocation of the non‑money good that is Pareto‑efficient is **unique** and equals the one you just computed,

$$
z_b^{PE}=\frac{\beta\,N}{\;M\sigma+\gamma N\;},\qquad z_s^{PE}=-\frac{M\beta}{\;M\sigma+\gamma N\;}.
$$

The distribution of money across buyers and sellers can vary freely. Any reallocation of the numéraire (lump‑sum transfers) that keeps the physical quantities at $$(z_b^{PE},z_s^{PE})$$ remains Pareto‑efficient. In the Edgeworth‑box language, the efficient set collapses to a single point in the non‑money dimension, but to a whole “ray” along the money dimension. By the SWT, any point on that ray can be decentralized by suitable endowments and the same relative price for the non‑money good.

#### Final answer

The non‑money allocations from (a) and (b) are identical:

$$
z_b^{*}=\frac{\beta\,N}{\;M\sigma+\gamma N\;},\qquad z_s^{*}=-\frac{M\beta}{\;M\sigma+\gamma N\;}.
$$
